_An agent-based model of tuberculosis' propagation in an urban setting_

Few studies have examined inexpensive systematic techniques for mechanically calibrating an agent-based model with reference input data. In particular, little is known about developing such mechanisms with learning features to boost execution times while preserving statistical significance. In this paper, a prototype of a Reinforcement Learning-based calibration device is implemented to computerize the parameter tuning procedure of a sample decision-assistance agent-based model. Precisely, this project navigates the attuning process of a Tuberculosis city-wide propagation model. The developed instrument delivers promising results since the evidence reveals that it fits the scheme's error trends satisfactorily in the one-dimensional scenario. Nonetheless, findings attest that the prototype, in its current state, needs further enhancements to achieve the desired goal. To be precise, the calibrator is currently unable to speed up tuning times because it cannot converge to the optimal policy in an environment with massive volatility. Conversely, the present work has delved beneath the surface and made a few valuable contributions to carry on a more extensive endeavor in future publications.
